**Subject:** Civil Society Contribution: Risk Modeling & Media Integrity Tools

Dear Partnership on AI Working Group Leads,

I am submitting an expression of interest on behalf of Saga Dog Corp, a Public Benefit Corporation creating civic-focused AI tools for media integrity, disinformation risk analysis, and AI governance.

Our flagship systems â€” Big Fly (entity risk mapper with probe traps) and SnapSentinel (browser metadata capture engine) â€” reflect our commitment to ethical, applied AI built in service of communities. We would be honored to join PAIâ€™s civil society initiatives or Media Integrity Working Group.

Weâ€™re especially aligned with your emphasis on transparency, synthetic media accountability, and systemic evaluation.

Looking forward to collaboration.

Respectfully,  
**Juan Rodriguez**  
Founder, Saga Dog Corp
