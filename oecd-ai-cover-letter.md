# ðŸ“© OECD AI Policy Observatory Cover Letter

**Subject:** Submission of Public Benefit Use Case â€“ Open-Source AI for Digital Integrity

Dear OECD AI Policy Team,

I am reaching out to contribute a real-world civic AI use case from Saga Dog Corp, a Public Benefit Corporation focused on building ethical OSINT and disinformation-mitigation tools. Our projects â€” SnapSentinel (browser-based forensic logger) and Neuromart (canonical narrative validator) â€” were designed to operationalize transparency, privacy, and governance.

We are interested in contributing these projects to your OECD AI Use Case Library. Our tools are open-source, impact-driven, and deeply aligned with the OECD Principles on Trustworthy AI.

Weâ€™d welcome the opportunity to join your catalog or future policy working sessions.

Sincerely,  
**Juan Rodriguez**  
Founder, Saga Dog Corp
