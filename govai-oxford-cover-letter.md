**Subject:** Proposal for Collaborative Research: Ethical OSINT Systems in Real-Time Governance

Dear GovAI Research Team,

Iâ€™m writing on behalf of Saga Dog Corp, a Florida-registered Public Benefit Corporation developing ethical, open-source AI systems to protect digital memory and investigate disinformation in real-time. Our recent toolsets â€” including the Big Fly Framework and SnapSentinel browser logger â€” offer applied pathways for mitigating AI-related risks through decentralized, community-based monitoring.

We believe our work aligns with GovAIâ€™s mission to shape the governance of advanced AI. Our projects contribute practically to topics like information hazards, narrative inversion, and simulation misuse. We are eager to explore research affiliation, data-sharing partnerships, or whitepaper collaboration.

Please find attached a summary of our tools and open-source civic infrastructure.

Thank you for considering a conversation.

Warm regards,  
**Juan Rodriguez**  
Founder, Saga Dog Corp
