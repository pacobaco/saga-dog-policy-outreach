**Subject:** Tool Contribution â€“ Civic AI Risk Modeling & Memory Integrity Stack

Dear AI Now Institute,

Iâ€™m reaching out from Saga Dog Corp, a Public Benefit Corporation building civic AI tools to support memory sovereignty and disinformation risk analysis. Our flagship projects â€” Big Fly (real-time enclave risk classifier) and SnapSentinel (browser forensic logger) â€” are open-source systems designed to help civil actors document and resist synthetic manipulation and metadata erasure.

Weâ€™d be honored to contribute a research brief, technical overview, or live demonstration to AI Nowâ€™s community. We believe our toolset intersects your priorities around AI accountability, labor, and surveillance resistance.

Appreciatively,  
**Juan Rodriguez**  
Founder, Saga Dog Corp
