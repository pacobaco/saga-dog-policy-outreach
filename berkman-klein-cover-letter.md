**Subject:** Fellowship/Research Proposal â€“ Narrative Identity, Symbolic AI, and Memory Traps

Dear BKC Team,

As the founder of Saga Dog Corp, a civic tech-focused Public Benefit Corporation, Iâ€™m reaching out to propose a research collaboration or future fellowship around the intersection of symbolic play, AI, and disinformation. Our project TPSE gamifies labor identities using DOL classifications, while SnapSentinel and Big Fly investigate metadata and narrative risks through OSINT tooling.

I believe our work aligns with BKCâ€™s focus on identity, algorithmic justice, and public digital infrastructure. Iâ€™d be grateful for the chance to present a research brief or contribute to an ongoing conversation on symbolic systems and civic memory.

Thank you for the important work you lead.

Warmly,  
**Juan Rodriguez**
