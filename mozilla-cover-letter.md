**Subject:** Mozilla Builders Contribution â€“ SnapSentinel Browser Forensic Layer

Dear Mozilla Trustworthy AI Team,

Iâ€™m writing to share SnapSentinel, a civic-focused browser extension we developed at Saga Dog Corp (a Public Benefit Corporation). SnapSentinel captures screenshots and metadata to enable individuals, journalists, and communities to document digital abuse, deception, and surveillance in real-time.

We believe this tool aligns with Mozillaâ€™s mission for trustworthy, transparent internet tools â€” and may fit into your Builders program, MozFest workshops, or case study features.

Weâ€™d love the opportunity to collaborate or present SnapSentinel in your upcoming forums.

Thank you for all your advocacy in building a healthier web.

With appreciation,  
**Juan Rodriguez**  
Founder, Saga Dog Corp
